  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a Communication and Computer Engineering student at Mansoura University with a CGPA of 3.72, passionate about
    AI, Data Science, Business Analysis, and Full-Stack Development. My learning journey has been intentionally
    structured — I organize my year into 12-week challenges to stay focused, with dedicated time for growth and
    recovery.</p>
  <p>I've built a solid foundation in classical machine learning, data cleaning, and visualization using Matplotlib and
    Seaborn, and I've explored core deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and ANNs. My technical path includes
    hands-on learning from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, training through Samsung
    Innovation Campus's AI program, and ongoing development via DataCamp and Coursera.</p>
  <p>I also have a strong problem-solving background from my experience with the ICPC Mansoura club (Level 1), and I'm
    currently deepening my skills in business analysis through Kreativstorm's remote training program. At the same time,
    I'm tackling graduation projects and preparing for the IELTS exam with a target band score of 7.5.</p>
  <p>Curious, consistent, and always evolving — I'm committed to bridging the gap between data, business, and
    development to create smart, scalable solutions.</p>
